# NHL-Travel-Web-App

This NHL travel web application was created for SA8905 (Fall 2017), a graduate level cartography course offered by the Department of Gegraphy at Ryerson University. 

This README will be updated over time, and the code will be updated to reflect any changes that improve upon the code.
